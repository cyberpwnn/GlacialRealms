  #  The default value of 100 should be safe for most cases.
  # 
  # Actions which require loaded chunks (e.g. copy) which do not load in time
  #  will use the last chunk as filler, which may appear as bands of duplicated blocks.
  # Actions usually wait about 25-50ms for the chunk to load, more if the server is lagging.
  # A value of 100ms does not force it to wait 100ms if the chunk loads in 10ms.
  # 
  # This value is a timeout in case a chunk is never going to load (for whatever odd reason).
  # If the action times out, the operation continues by using the previous chunk as filler,
  #  and displaying an error message.  In this case, either copy a smaller section,
  #  or increase chunk-wait-ms.
  # A value of 0 is faster simply because it doesn't bother loading the chunks or waiting.
